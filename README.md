Data analysis on the NBA mvp dataset found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/danchyy/nba-mvp-votings-through-history
Heavily inspired by a reddit post crossposted from Medium: https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-2018-19-nbas-most-valuable-player-using-machine-learning-512e577032e3

Analysis done in R Markdown and requires the datasets above and the following R Libraries (None are that big):
tidyverse
caret
ggplot2
glmnet
randomForest
neuralnet
corrplot
